# Install Stack

The recommended method for getting up and running is to [install
Stack](http://haskellstack.org). As a quick
overview: Stack is a full-featured Haskell build tool that will install
necessary build tools (like the Glasgow Haskell Compiler- GHC), and is
preloaded with support for Stackage snapshots- both LTS Haskell and Stackage
Nightly.
